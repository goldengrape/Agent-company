Meta and Nvidia Announce Massive Data Center Expansion\nMeta has significantly expanded its partnership with Nvidia in a multi-billion dollar deal. The agreement involves the deployment of millions of AI-specialized GPUs and Nvidia's new standalone CPUs across Meta\u2019s global data center network. This move underscores Meta's commitment to scaling its generative AI capabilities and infrastructure, signaling continued dominance for Nvidia in the AI hardware market.\n\n### 2. Researchers Call for Biosecurity Guardrails on AI Data\nA coalition of researchers from top institutions\u2014including Johns Hopkins, Oxford, Stanford, and NYU\u2014has issued an urgent call for \"biosecurity guardrails.\" The group warns that unrestricted access to infectious disease datasets could allow advanced AI models to assist in the design of deadly viruses. They are advocating for international standards to restrict the use of sensitive biological data in AI training sets to mitigate catastrophic risks.\n\n### 3. Surge in U.S. AI Startup Funding\nDespite broader market volatility, the AI startup ecosystem remains white-hot. Reports from today indicate that at least 17 U.S.-based AI startups successfully closed significant funding rounds in the last 24 hours. This influx of capital highlights investor confidence in niche AI applications and next-generation model architectures, even as Wall Street remains cautious about the long-term ROI of massive infrastructure spending.\n\n---\n*End of Briefing*"
